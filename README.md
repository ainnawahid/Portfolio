# Data Science Portfolio – Ainna Wahid
Welcome to my data science portfolio — a compilation of academic, self-learning, and real-world projects I’ve completed during my Master's in Data Science (2023–2024) at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and beyond. This space also includes certifications that reflect my continuous growth and hands-on experience in data analytics, machine learning, business intelligence, and sustainability-related data projects.

### Olist E-commerce SQL & NoSQL Database Modeling
Modeled a relational and document-based database for Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform. Created insights via SQL queries (joins, subqueries, indexes), then transformed the schema into MongoDB collections using embedded and reference designs.
